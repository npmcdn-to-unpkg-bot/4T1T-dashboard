# 4T1T-dashboard
Mainly developed as a programming exercise, this project serves as a simple dashboard for a little amateur gaming team.
Its main purpose is storing informations regarding the players, such as the favourite and best characters, and providing strategic aid for the game.

The project is developed using the [MEAN stack](http://mean.io/), and it therefore consists in a Node.js based back end, that stores data in a MongoDB database and provides a REST API routed through Express.js.
For the user interaction, the application comes with an AngularJS front end that interacts with the API to retrieve and store the data, and provides a pleasant User Interface, designed using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/); the interface is fully responsive, and allows for a comfortable interaction.
